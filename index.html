                begin() – Returns an iterator pointing to the first element in the vector
                end() – Returns an iterator pointing to the theoretical element that follows the last element in the vector
                rbegin() – Returns a reverse iterator pointing to the last element in the vector (reverse beginning). It moves from last to first element
                rend() – Returns a reverse iterator pointing to the theoretical element preceding the first element in the vector (considered as reverse end)
                cbegin() – Returns a constant iterator pointing to the first element in the vector.
                cend() – Returns a constant iterator pointing to the theoretical element that follows the last element in the vector.
                crbegin() – Returns a constant reverse iterator pointing to the last element in the vector (reverse beginning). It moves from last to first element
                crend() – Returns a constant reverse iterator pointing to the theoretical element preceding the first element in the vector (considered as reverse end)
